This is a Unity project utilizing several standard free assets. It's a goal for myself to see how much of a game I can create under short time constraints. 

This project, I learned how to use terrain generation in Unity to create a large open world environment. I was attempting to understand more of the key tenets of game design, namely:

1. creating environments which "feel" real.
2. making a world which fits the tone of the game.
3. ensure that the world can be traversable and "guides" the player to their objective.

In addition, the game was created with the intention for audio design to be a key driver towards making the game playable and fun. Thus, objectives are "obscured" without the music included.
